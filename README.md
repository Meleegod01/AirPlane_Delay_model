Objective: 
The primary objective of this project is to analyze flight data to uncover insights that can help improve operations and decision-making within the aviation industry.

Scope: 
The analysis covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and predictive modeling. The scope is limited to the available dataset and does not account for external factors.



Note: app.py and index.html are used for deployment while the rest are the code base in different forms in which the model is trained differently from the deployed where you can see the use of ipywidgets. "airline_delay.csv" is the basic dataset for the model.
